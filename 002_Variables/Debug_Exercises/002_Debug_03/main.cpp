// 2 ERRORS - SCROLL DOWN FOR SOLUTIONS

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	bool b = True;
	char c = "c";
	double d = 3.3;
	float f = 2;
	int i = 4.4;
	cout << b << c << d << f << i << endl;
	return 0;
}






































// line 7: 'True' should be all lower case, so it's 'true'
// line 8: char should have it's value in single quotes ['], not double quotes ["]

// NOTE: line 10 having a float value without a decimal works fine.
// NOTE: line 11 setting a float value into an int will round it down, and work fine.
